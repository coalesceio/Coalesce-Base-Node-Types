### Factless Fact Node Configuration

The Fact node has two configuration groups:

* [Node Properties](#factless-fact-node-properties)
* [Options](#factless-fact-options)

#### Factless Fact Node Properties

| **Properties** | **Description** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Storage Location** | Storage Location where the WORK will be created |
| **Node Type** | Name of template used to create node objects |
| **Description** | A description of the node's purpose |
| **Deploy Enabled** | If TRUE the node will be deployed / redeployed when changes are detected<br/> If FALSE the node will not be deployed or will be dropped during redeployment |

#### Factless Fact Options

| **Multi Source** | Toggle: True/False<br/>Implementation of SQL UNIONs<br/>**True**: Combine multiple sources in a single node<br/>True Options:<br/>- **UNION**: Combines with duplicate elimination<br/>- **UNION ALL**: Combines without duplicate elimination<br/>**False**: Single source node or multiple sources combined using a join |
| **Truncate Before** | Toggle: True/False<br/>This determines whether a table will be overwritten each time a task executes. **True**: Uses INSERT OVERWRITE<br/>**False**: Uses INSERT to append data |
| **Enable tests** | Toggle: True/False<br/>Determines if tests are enabled |
| **Distinct** | Toggle: True/False<br/>**True**: Group by All is invisible. DISTINCT data is chosen for processing<br/>**False**: Group by All is visible |
| **Group by All** | Toggle: True/False<br/>**True**: DISTINCT is invisible. Data is grouped by all columns for processing<br/>**False**: DISTINCT is visible |
| **Order By** | Toggle: True/False<br/>**True**: Sort column and sort order drop down are visible and are required to form order by clause<br/>**False**: Sort column and sort order drop down are invisible |
| **Pre-SQL** | SQL to execute before data insert operation |
| **Post-SQL** | SQL to execute after data insert operation |

### Factless Fact Joins

Join conditions and other clauses like where, qualify can be specified in the join space next to mapping of columns in the UI.

> ðŸ“˜ **Specify Group by and Order by Clauses**
>
> You should specify group by and order by clauses in this space if you are not opting for the group by all and order by provided in OPTIONS config.

### Factless Fact Deployment

#### Factless Fact Initial Deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the Factless Fact node of materialization type table will execute the Create Fact Table stage.

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Create Fact Table** | This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a table in the target environment |

#### Factless Fact Redeployment

After the Fact node has been deployed for the first time into a target environment, subsequent deployments may result in either altering the Fact Table or recreating the Fact table.

#### Altering the Factless Fact Tables

A few types of column or table changes will result in an ALTER statement to modify the Factless Fact Table in the target environment, whether these changes are made individually or all together:

* Changing table names
* Dropping existing columns
* Altering column data types
* Adding new columns

The following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Clone Table** | Creates an internal table |
| **Rename Table\| Alter Column \| Delete Column \| Add Column \| Edit table description** | Alter table statement is executed to perform the alter operation |
| **Swap Cloned Table** | Upon successful completion of all updates, the clone replaces the main table ensuring that no data is lost |
| **Delete Table** | Drops the internal table |

#### Recreating the Factless Fact Tables

If any of the following change are detected, then the table will be recreated using a CREATE or REPLACE.

* Join clause
* Adding transformations
* Change in business key
* Changes in configuration like adding distinct, group by, or order by

One of the following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Create Table** | Creates a new table |
| **Replace Table** | Replaces an existing table|

### Factless Fact Undeployment

If a Fact Node is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the Fact Table in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in two stages:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Delete Table** | Coalesce Internal table is dropped |
| **Delete Table** | Target table in Snowflake is dropped |

## View 

The Coalesce View UDN is a versatile node that allows you to develop and deploy a View in Snowflake.

A view allows the result of a query to be accessed as if it were a table. Views serve a variety of purposes, including combining, segregating, and protecting data.

### View Node Configuration

The View node type has two configuration groups:

* [Node Properties](#view-node-properties)
* [Options](#view-options)

![Fact_config](https://github.com/coalesceio/Coalesce-Base-Node-Types/assets/7216836/6f863c3b-3abd-4318-bd7e-ed50a829f911)

#### View Node Properties

| **Properties** | **Description** |
|----------|-------------|
| **Storage Location** | Storage Location where the WORK will be created |
| **Node Type** | Name of template used to create node objects |
| **Description** | A description of the node's purpose |
| **Deploy Enabled** | If TRUE the node will be deployed / redeployed when changes are detected<br/> If FALSE the node will not be deployed or will be dropped during redeployment |

#### View Options

| **Options** | **Description** |
|---------|-------------|
| **Override Create SQL** | Toggle: True/False<br/>**True**: Customized Create SQL specified in the Create SQL space is executed. All other options are invisible<br/>**False**: Create view SQL based on options chosen are framed and executed |
| **Multi Source** | Toggle: True/False<br/>Implementation of SQL UNIONs<br/>**True**: Combine multiple sources in a single node<br/>True Options:<br/>- **UNION**: Combines with duplicate elimination<br/>- **UNION ALL**: Combines without duplicate elimination<br/>**False**: Single source node or multiple sources combined using a join |
| **Distinct** | Toggle: True/False<br/>**True**: Group by All is invisible. DISTINCT data is chosen for processing<br/>**False**: Group by All is visible |
| **Group by All** | Toggle: True/False<br/>**True**: DISTINCT is invisible. Data is grouped by all columns for processing<br/>**False**: DISTINCT is visible |
| **Secure** | Toggle: True/False<br/>**True**: A secured view is created<br/>**False**: A normal view is created |

### View Joins

Join conditions and other clauses like where, qualify can be specified in the join space next to mapping of columns in the Coalesce app.

> ðŸ“˜ **Specify Group by Clauses**
>
> Best Practice is to specify group by clauses in this space if you are not opting for the group by all provided in OPTIONS config.

### View Deployment

#### View Initial Deployment

When deployed for the first time into an environment the View node will execute the Create View stage.

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Create View** | This will execute a CREATE OR REPLACE statement and create a View in the target environment |

#### View Redeployment

The subsequent deployment of View node with changes in view definition, adding table description, adding secure option or renaming view results in deleting the existing view and recreating the view.

The following stages are executed:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Delete View** | Removes existing view |
| **Create View** | Creates new view with updated definition |

#### View Undeployment

If a View Node is deleted from a Workspace, that Workspace is committed to Git and that commit deployed to a higher level environment then the View in the target environment will be dropped.

This is executed in the below stage:

| **Stage** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Delete View** | Removes the view from the environment |
